# Steganography-Web-App
A web application that allows one to *hide* and *read* messages from an image.
Users can also flip messages vertically and horizontally.


# Note
*Please first encode messages into an image before decoding*
The site will break otherwise (unless the image has already been encoded). 
Images are full of random data that the application can't read
